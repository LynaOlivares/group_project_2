## Sources
* [***Food & Nutrition Database For Dietary Studies***](https://developer.adzuna.com/)
 FNDDS is a database that provides the nutrient values for foods and beverages reported in What We Eat in America, the dietary intake component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

 * [***% Daily Value***](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/InteractiveNutritionFactsLabel/pdv.html)
 The % Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient is in one serving of the food. The %DVs are based on the Daily Values for key nutrients, which are the amounts (in grams, milligrams, or micrograms) of nutrients recommended per day for Americans 4 years of age and older. The %DV column doesnâ€™t add up vertically to 100%. Instead, the %DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in one serving of the food.
